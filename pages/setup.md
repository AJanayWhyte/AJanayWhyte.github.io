### Virtual Machine software

There are several different types of virtual machine software. However, we will discuss how to use and setup two different ones. They are called Oracle virtualBox or VMware Workstation.

Most often choosing a virtual machine software is all about preference. I personally have both versions of the virtual box downloaded. I have done this simply due to that fact that sometimes a downloaded target virtual machine doesn't work with either box. You can find the link to each virtual machine software below.
